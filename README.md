# The responsive design

For this project were implemented two mediaqueries that present the content for devices with screensizes smaller than 768px, between 768 and 1028px and above 1028px. every item in the site resizes, shrinks or grows, to show all the content to the visitor in a fluid manner, taking care of the principles of UX and UI
